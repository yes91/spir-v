    -- | Apply to a variable. Part of the main linkage between the API and SPIR-V modules for memory buffers, images, etc. See the API specification for more information.

    -- | Apply to a structure-type member. This gives the byte offset of the member relative to the beginning of the structure. Can be used, for example, by both uniform and transform-feedback buffers. It must not cause any overlap of the structureâ€™s members, or overflow of a transform-feedback bufferâ€™s __XfbStride__.
  | Offset
    -- | Apply to an object or a member of a structure type. Indicates which transform-feedback buffer an output is written to. Only valid for the __Output__ <https:\/\/www.khronos.org\/registry\/spir-v\/specs\/1.0\/SPIRV.html#Storage_Class Storage Classes> of /<https:\/\/www.khronos.org\/registry\/spir-v\/specs\/1.0\/SPIRV.html#VertexProcessor vertex processing>/ <https:\/\/www.khronos.org\/registry\/spir-v\/specs\/1.0\/SPIRV.html#Execution_Model Execution Models>.

  | LinkageAttributes
    -- | Apply to an <https:\/\/www.khronos.org\/registry\/spir-v\/specs\/1.0\/SPIRV.html#Arithmetic arithmetic instruction> to indicate the operation cannot be combined with another instruction to form a single operation. For example, if applied to an __<https:\/\/www.khronos.org\/registry\/spir-v\/specs\/1.0\/SPIRV.html#OpFMul OpFMul>__, that multiply canâ€™t be combined with an addition to yield a fused multiply-add operation. Furthermore, such operations are not allowed to reassociate; e.g., add(a + add(b+c)) cannot be transformed to add(add(a+b) + c).
